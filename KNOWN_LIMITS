If order to keep the code simple and clean, some technical limitations had to be decided.
When modifying the code, you must take account of them, and change them if they prove to be insuficient.
This file is made in order to help you know what those are and where they are located.

*** Stack size ***
-> Initial stack is 1MB large.
   (in arch/x86_64/bootstrap/bs_multiboot.s)
*** Module size ***
-> The kernel is loaded at virtual address 2 GB. This theoretically shouldn't be an issue.
   (in support/kernel_linker.lds)
*** Page size ***
-> Currently, all pages are of the same size : 4KB
   (in build_all.sh, arch/x86_64/bootstrap/bs_multiboot.s, support/*.lds and include/align.h)
*** Kernel memory map ***
-> In the x86_64 bootstrap kernel, memory map can't be more than 512 entries long.
